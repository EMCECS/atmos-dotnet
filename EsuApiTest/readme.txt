Running the Testcases
---------------------

To run the testcases, first edit the testcase class and set the IP address of
the ESU node you want to connect to, your UID, and shared secret.  Start the 
NUnit GUI, select Open Project..., and navigate to the .dll you wish to 
test (testing the Debug version is recommended) and click the start screen to 
run the tests.
